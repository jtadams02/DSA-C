# DSA-C
Data Structures and Algorithms implemented in C++

Currently I have created 3 different Data Structures:

## Heap/Binary Heap  
An implementation of both a Heap and a more complicated Binary Heap (A binary tree that satisfies the min-heap property)

## Red/Back Tree
An implementation of a self-balancing binary tree. Maintains the BST property on its own

## Circular Dynamic Array
An implementation of a Circular Array that allows O(1) front and back access. Also allocates for reversing in O(1) time. 
Very hard implementation
